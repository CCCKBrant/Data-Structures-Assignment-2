Design Memo: Write Your Design Memo Include a 200â€“300 word response in your code or in a .txt file:
- How does your list work?
  My list is a linked list, which means it uses methods to add in numerical order values,
  or in this circumstance names, to a created list. You also have the ability to search for and remove
  what you are looking for from the list. In this particular assignment we created a waitlist, and we 
  can add to the front, add to the back, remove, and print the waitlist in order to run the business.
  Linked lists allow us to work with a waitlist that can potentially be large and constantly modified. 
- What role does the head play?
  The head is an important role that either tells you if the list is empty, or point to the first value
  in that list. This is important because we need to use the head in order to use our methods. Add to the
  head, or add to the head next (adding after the head value).
- When might a real engineer need a custom list like this?
  A real engineer might need a custom list like this because of the infinite possibility of what you can add
  and subtract from the list. It doesn't just have a set list of items, you can make methods that add versitality
  to normal lists. With a complex job like engineering, you need versatality.
